## Theoretical Link between <br> Deliberation and Regime Legitimacy 


---

## Theory

+ Central claim of deliberative theory: 
    + to arrive at (more) legitimate decisions 
    + see for example Habermas (1994: 7–8) & Warren & Gastil (2015: 562)


--
+ Conceptualization of legitimacy as regime support 


--
+ General assumption: deliberative qualities of a political system increase support from its citizens


--
+ Consequences of *Authoritarian Deliberation* (He & Warren, 2011)
    + Authoritarian regimes might use deliberation to *increase* support  
    + Might *decrease* support due to increasing democratic capabilites

## Data & Methodology


---

#### Data & Methodology

**Individual-Level Data**
+ Merging of the following datasets: 
  + Afrobarometer Survey, Round 5 and Round 6 (data from 2011-2015)  
  + Asian Barometer Survey, Wave 3 and Wave 4 (2010-2015) 
  + AmericasBarometer (2010-2014) 
  + European Social Survey, Round 6 (2012) 
  + Latinobarómetro (2015) 
  + World Values Survey (2010-2014)

+ In total 316,938 individual cases in 119 Countries
  + weighted to same sample size (=1000)


--

**Country-Level Data**
+ "Varieties of Democracy"-Dataset: Deliberative Component Index
+ Control variables come from V-Dem and the QoG-Dataset
+ Lagging of Independent Variables (Averaging from 2000 - 2010)

---

#### Data & Methodology

.ninetyfive[

+ Control Variables
    + Micro Level
        + Age
        + Sex (Male/Female)
        + Financial Security
        + Education
        + Employment (0/1)
    + Macro Level
        + Polity/FH
        + Democracy (0/1)<sup>1</sup>
        + Autocracy (0/1)<sup>1</sup>
        + logged GDP per capita
        + logged Population
        + Life Expectancy
        + Urban Pop. Ratio
    + Survey dummies
        + WVS, Afrobarometer, Latinobarometro, Americasbarometer, Asianbarometer, ESS
        
]

<font size='1'><sup>1</sup>We apply the Polity2-classification of democracies, anocracies and autocracies. Polity/FH was rescaled to range from -10 to +10 and the cut-off values are set at 6 and -6 (-10 – -6 = Autocracy; -5 – 5 =Anocracy; 6 – 10 = Democracy).</font>

## Operationalization of Regime Support

Three types of traditional political branches
+ executive (political leadership)
+ judicial and legal system (courts and police)
+ legislation (parliament)

## Deliberative Component Index (DCI)

## Challenges

---

## Challenges

*Two major challenges emerged:*

+ Colinearity between Deliberation indicators and Democracy Measures

--

+ Possibly biased self-reported regime support 

--

<br>

#### Multicolinearity issue


<img src="images/corr_table.png">

---

#### Correlation between DCI and Polity/FH

#### Possibly biased self-reported Regime Support

#### Correlation between Regime Support and Discussion Suppression

## Analysis & Results

---

## Analysis

Given the hierarchical nature of the data we estimate *multilevel models*
+ Dependent Variables
    + Regime Support *(No Bias)*   -> `ICC: 44.97%`
    + Regime Support *(Low Bias)*  -> `ICC: 41.70%`
    + Regime Support *(High Bias)* -> `ICC: 40.97%`

--
    
+ Main independent variables
    + Deliberative Component Index (DCI)
    + plus all five components of the DCI

--

+ In total 91 seperate models
    + split into three subsamples (Complete, Democracies, Non-Democracies)
 
--

*Note: complete sample uses dummy variables of Polity/FH because of non-linearity and multicolinearity issues*

## Conclusions & Future Research

---

## Conclusions & Future Research

* No simple answer to research question
 + deliberation seems to have a *positive effect* on regime support *in democracies*
 + less robust and *ambiguous results for non-democracies and complete sample*
    
--

* Presumably biased regime support
 + should be taken into account 
 + possible remedies? (e.g. weighting procedures, survey design)
 + individual-level vs. country-level weighting?

--


* Validity of the DCI
    + more sensitive approaches to measure deliberation on the country level are neccessary
    + nevertheless interesting differences regarding the subsamples
