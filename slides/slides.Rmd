Research Question:

> What role does the deliberative quality of a political system play for regime legitimacy?

## Theoretical Link between <br> Deliberation and Regime Legitimacy 

---

### Theory

> Deliberation in its original sense contains the process of ***rational consideration of arguments***, in which participants provide ***reasoned justification*** for their positions, relate to the ***common good***, ***respect other opinions*** and are willing to ***yield to better arguments***

.center[
<i> for an overview see Bächtiger et al. (2010) </i> 
]
--

+ Central claim of deliberative theory: to arrive at (more) legitimate decisions 

.center[ <i> see Habermas (1994), Chambers (1996) & Parkinson (2006) </i> ]
    
--

+  Legitimacy conceptualized sociologically: regime support 


--

+ General assumption: *deliberative qualities* of a political system increase support from its citizens


--

+ Consequences of *Authoritarian Deliberation* (He & Warren, 2011)
    + Authoritarian regimes might use deliberation to *increase* support  
    + Might *decrease* support due to increasing democratic capabilites

## Data & Methodology


---

#### Data & Methodology

**Individual-Level Data**
+ Merging of the following datasets: 
  + Afrobarometer Survey, Round 5 and Round 6 (data from 2011-2015)  
  + Asian Barometer Survey, Wave 3 and Wave 4 (2010-2015) 
  + AmericasBarometer (2010-2014) 
  + European Social Survey, Round 6 (2012) 
  + Latinobarometro (2015) 
  + World Values Survey (2010-2014)

+ In total 316,938 individual cases in 119 Countries
  + weighted to same sample size (=1000)


--

**Country-Level Data**
+ "Varieties of Democracy"-Dataset: Deliberative Component Index
+ Control variables come from V-Dem and the QoG-Dataset

## Deliberative Component Index (DCI)

#### Data & Methodology

.ninetyfive[

+ Control Variables
    + Micro Level
        + Age
        + Sex (Male/Female)
        + Financial Security
        + Education
        + Employment (0/1)
    + Macro Level
        + Polity/FH
        + Democracy (0/1)<sup>1</sup>
        + Autocracy (0/1)<sup>1</sup>
        + logged GDP per capita
        + logged Population
        + Life Expectancy
        + Urban Pop. Ratio
    + Survey dummies
        + WVS, Afrobarometer, Latinobarometro, Americasbarometer, Asianbarometer, ESS
        
]

<font size='1'><sup>1</sup>We apply the Polity2-classification of democracies, anocracies and autocracies. Polity/FH was rescaled to range from -10 to +10 and the cut-off values are set at 6 and -6 (-10 - -6 = Autocracy; -5 - 5 = Anocracy; 6 - 10 = Democracy).</font>

## Analytical Challenges

---

## Analytical Challenges

*Two major challenges emerged:*

1. Collinearity between Deliberation indicators and Democracy Measures

--

2. Possibly biased self-reported regime support 

--

<br>

#### 1st Challenge: Multicollinearity

#### 1st Challenge: Correlation between DCI and Polity/FH

#### 2nd Challenge: Possibly biased self-reported Regime Support

## Analysis & Results

---

## Analysis

Given the hierarchical nature of the data we estimate *multilevel models*
+ Dependent Variables
    + Regime Support *(No Bias)*   -> `ICC: 44.97%`
    + Regime Support *(Low Bias)*  -> `ICC: 41.70%`
    + Regime Support *(High Bias)* -> `ICC: 40.97%`

--
    
+ Main independent variables
    + Deliberative Component Index (DCI)
    + plus all five components of the DCI

--

+ In total 91 seperate models
    + split into three subsamples (Complete, Democracies, Non-Democracies)

## Conclusions & Future Research

---

## Conclusions

+ Complete Sample:
     + Positive effects on regime support when controlling for democracy
     + Otherwise small and insignificant effects
     
+ Democracy Sample:
    + Deliberative quality has a clear *positive effect*
    + Most robust results
    
+ Non-Democracy Sample:
    + Ambigious results (mostly insignificant)
    + Only *Common Good* Indicator shows some effect 


---

## Future Research

* Presumably biased regime support
 + should be taken into account 
 + possible remedies? (e.g. weighting procedures, survey design)
 + individual-level vs. country-level weighting?

* Validity of the DCI
    + more sensitive approaches to measure deliberation on the country level are neccessary
    + nevertheless interesting differences regarding the subsamples
